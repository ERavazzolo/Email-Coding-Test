# Email Coding Test
This is a coding test project: Build a responsive email

## Approach

After some research on how to build an HTML email template, I decided to approach the project using a table-based layout as it's still the most supported method. 

## Process
1. Analyse the design: I created a rough wireframe of the design using Figma and printed it. This allowed me to reflect on all components of the design and on how to reuse certain styles throughout the email, noting aside class names. It also helped me to visualise and break down a table-based layout.
2. Development process: I started coding the HTML template using a separate stylesheet. Then, I moved my CSS in my HTML within <style>.
3. Build: I used an inliner tool to move my CSS inline. I then sent myself the email so I could see what needed to be fixed and proceeded to apply the necessary changes.
